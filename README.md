# React Bootcamp Projects

Welcome to my collection of mini React projects! ðŸŽ‰

This repository showcases the fundamental concepts and basic functions of React that I learned during my bootcamp. Each project is designed to practice and solidify my understanding of Reactâ€™s core features, including components, state management, hooks, and event handling.

## ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s inside?
- Small-scale projects demonstrating the power of React.
- Hands-on examples focusing on key React features.
- A great resource for anyone looking to get more familiar with React!

## ðŸš€ What Iâ€™ve learned:
- Creating reusable components.
- Managing state with hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Understanding the component lifecycle.
- Building interactive UIs and handling events.
- And much more!

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute! Looking forward to sharing my React journey with you.
